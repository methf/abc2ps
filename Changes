----- Version 1.5.0 -----

15.05.2019 Removed GPL code from playabc.
           Renamed getline function to avoid compilation problems on Mac.
           Relicensed as LGPL-3.0-or-later.

----- Version 1.4.2 (experimental) -----

13.12.99 Fixed slurs/ties into first and second endings.


----- Version 1.4.0 (experimental) -----

06.12.99 added audio playback. 
         Chords, grace notes, multiple voices, and repeats work. 
         Note decorations are ignored.

         Usage: Flag -a instructs to write audio file Abc.au together with 
         the usual postscript output. It is not possible to get the audio file 
         without the postscript. The output is in Sun/Next audio format, as
         indicated by the extension au. The au file can then be played using 
         something like "audiotool" or "soundtool" on a Sun, or by catting it
         to /dev/audio, say on Linux. Doubleclicking in Windoze probably also works,
         depending on the specific operating system. Flag -a implies -o. 
         The tempo can be set with flag -Q and defaults to 120 quarter-beats 
         per minute. There are some different "sounds", oriented somewhat towards
         specific musical instruments, as far as this can be done with simple means.
         These are selected with flag -q (for "quality"). 
         
         Thus:

            abc2ps -o infile           - makes Postscript only, as usual.
            abc2ps -o infile -a        - makes both Abc.au and Postscript
            abc2ps -a infile           - same as above
            abc2ps -a infile -Q 160    - does the same with tempo Q=160
            abc2ps -a infile -q135     - uses audio quality 1,3,5 for the first, 
                                         second, and third voice, respectively.

         Alternatively, pseudocomments can be used in the abc input file
         or in a .fmt file, for example:
      
            %%playtempo 160
            %%auquality 135
   
         To see the parameters whcih determine the audio output, set the
         verbosity to 5 or higher (ie. use -v5).

         To compile: you can use the supplied audio functions in sox.h 
         (taken from playabc) or (on a Sun) use the system library. 
         Edit Makefile to set CC, CFLAGS, and LDFLAGS appropriately 
         then type make.

         The waveforms are generated on the fly, which is a bit slower than
         writing Postscript only. Sine wave samples are significantly faster 
         to generate than triangle or sawtooth waves.

         Currently the sound qualities are somewhat along these lines (but please 
         don't take this too seriously!):
            1  piano
            2  accordeon
            3  flute
            4  cembalo
            5  organ
            6  guitar, or bass, or something else plucked.



08.07.99 Improvements by Christoph Dalitz:
       o Source spread over several source files. Makefile added.

       o cap_str (util.c):
         system call toupper used, so that umlauts
         are translated as well (depends on locale)

       o isdigit (util.c): removed (are already in ctype.h)

       o isblank (util.c): replaced with isblankstr 
         (confusion with isblank in ctype.h)

       o def_staff (syms.c):
         linewidth increased (0.6 instead of 0.5)

       o new clef "treble8" (modern tenor clef)


----- Version 1.3.2 -----

10.08.98 Added new codes for accents (cf. sample.abc):
            k: Accent which looks like >
            K: Accent which looks like an upside-down V.


05.08.98 Added bar numbering and bar labels.
         
         Bar numbers: 
         to switch on bar numbering, use flag -k
         where:   -k 1     numbers every bar
                  -k 5     numbers every fifth bar, etc.
                  -k 0     numbers the first bar in every staff.
         or, use the equivalent pseudocomment %%barnumbers <number>.
         (Note: -k was used because it sounds a bit like "count".)

         The program counts through the bars automatically, trying
         to do the right thing at first and second endings. Namely:
         it remembers the bar number at the start of the first ending,
         then resets to that value at the start of the second ending.
         So, if there is a tune with 2x8 measures with first and second
         endings after the first 8 bars, we still end up with 16 bars
         in total.
         Within one tune, bar numbers are counted through over parts
         boundaries. However, if a T: title appears inside a tune,
         the bar number is reset to 1. You can use an empty T:
         line to reset the bar number without actually writing a title.

      
         Bar labels: 
         this is intended for large letters A, B, C...
         to mark specific points in the music. They are coded by
         using a syntax similar to guitarchords, but placed before
         a bar line instead of a note or rest, e.g.:
            | abcd "A"| ABCD |
         places the letter A over the second bar line.
         Just in case somebody wants a label on the first bar
         (which is often not preceded by a bar line), a new 
         symbol [|] was introduced for an "invisible" bar line.


         Fonts for bar numbers and bar labels:
         These can be set in the usual way with the two pseudocomments 
         %%barnumberfont and %%barlabelfont.
         
         In printed music, the bar numbers are often made more visible
         by putting a box around them. This is now also possible.
         In fact, a box can be put around most bits of text by
         adding the word "box" to the font specification, e.g.:

            %%barnumberfont Times-Italic 11 box

         This can be done for the title, guitarchords, vocals, etc.
         To switch on the box without changing the font style and/or size,
         the character * can be used, as in:
      
            %%titlefont * * box
         
         
         A reminder: to see all the style specifications use 'abc2ps -H'
         (for the standard format) or 'abc2ps -PH' (pretty2 format).
         This gives a list suitable for placing in a .fmt file.
         To modify settings for a single tune only, place the
         pseudocomments after the 'T:' lines and before the 'K:' line
         in the tune header.

         
         Examples: look at celloprelude.abc for examples of bar numbers
         and bar labels. Try 'abc2ps -maxv 8 -k0 bran5' or
         'abc2ps -k0 bach' to see bar numbers at the start of 
         the line, as is often used for scores.



20.07.98 Fixed bug overwriting when lvoiceid too short.

----- Version 1.3.1 -----

12.07.98 A number of enhancements to format multi-stave music nicely.
         For examples, see files trio.abc bran5.abc voices.abc bach.abc.
      
         In detail: indentation of the first staff, labels for voices, 
         braces and brackets to group voices, and some additional
         parameters in the V: line to control the output.

         As before, the syntax of the V: line is

            V: <label> <par1>=<value1> <par2>=<value2>  ...
         
         where <label> is used to switch to the voice in later V: lines.
         Each <par>=<value> pair sets one parameter for the current voice.
         There are now alternate short version of the parameter names.


         List of the parameters allowed in a V: line:

         parm   short   example and description
         ----------------------------------------

         name    nm     nm=Violin I" 
                        This sets the long version of the voice name, to be
                        written before the staves at the start of a piece.
                        If the string contains \\, this is interpreted
                        as a line break and the pieces are writen above
                        each other.

         sname   snm    snm="Vl. I"
                        Short version of the name, written before
                        subsequent staves.
      
         clef    cl     clef=bass
                        Chooses the clef (treble, alto, or bass).
                        It can also be bass+8 and so on.
         
         staves  stv    stv=2
                        This is the number of staves (starting from the
                        current one) to connect by tall vertical bar lines.
                        
         brace   brc    brace=2 
                        This is the number of staves (starting from the
                        current one) to be grouped together with a brace.
                        When this option is used, the name defined in the
                        same V: line is written at the center of the brace.

         bracket brk    brk=4
                        The number of staves to be grouped together by
                        a bracket. This option does not change the way
                        in which the names are written.

         space   spc    spc=40
                        This defines or modifies the vertical space between
                        this staff and the one below it. The space can be
                        given in pt (default) or with a unit in the form 
                        1cm or 0.4in. Furthermore: if a + or - sign
                        comes after the start of the number, the value
                        is an increment to be added to or subtracted
                        from the default setting.

         gchords gch    gch=0  
                        This controls whether any guitar chords 
                        embedded in the current voice are actually written.
                        True/false are specified as for the %% formats. 

         stems   stm    stems=up
                        This is parsed but not yet used in the program.


         New format directives:

            %%voicefont       font to write voice names with

            %%indent <dim>    amount to indent the first staff.
                              Indentation is done at the start of
                              the piece and after a T: field, but not
                              after a P: field. 

            Note: the margin still refers to the left edge of the staff.
            Therefore, parameters %%leftmargin %%staffwidth %%indent
            should be adjusted to leave room for the voice names.


         New command-line flag:

            The -V flag was redefined to select voices for output.
            The old function ("show version") was integrated into -h.
            The format is as in this example:

               abc2ps -o input.abc -V 1-2,4
            
            This will generate output only for the specified voices. 
            Specifically, a single voice can be extracted.
    

         Other changes:

            For a rest which fills out a complete measure, the symbol 
            for a full rest is drawn in the center of the bar, independent
            of the the time signature.

            Added K for strong emphasis decoration (upside-down V).




31.05.98 L: after header but before first voice now sets default length
         for first voice, named "1".

12.05.98 Tab interpreted as space in music lines.

01.04.98 Fixed Q:C=xxx for multi-stave version.

19.03.98 Run-time allocation for symbols and voices.


----- Version 1.3.0 -----

03.03.98 Multi-stave music added.

         To switch to a different voice, use a line starting with 'V:'.
         An example for the most general form supported now is:
            V:2 name="Clarinet 2" short="Cl.2" clef=treble stems=down 
         Note that the "2" is a treated as a string, so any single-word
         identifier can be used instead. Later in the tune,
         switch to the voice using only
            V:2
         The various settings (key, default length, etc) are 
         maintained for each voice separately.
   
         Guitar chords, first and second endings, and line breaks are 
         taken from the top voice only. Vocals can be set under each
         voice separately.

         To format the output, two %% format directives were added
         which determine the staff spacing: %%systaffsep %%systemsep.

         It turned out that the note spacing should be slightly
         different for multi-stave music. Namely, it is often a good
         idea to space the notes somewhat more strictly according
         to their duration than in single-stave music. There is now
         a new parameter called "strictness" which the user can use
         to adjust this. For strictness=1, the spacings for notes
         with short durations is reasonably strictly proportional to
         their duration. For strictness=0, they are spaced about
         equally. Good defaults are strictness=0.5 for single-stave
         music and strictness=0.8 for multistave music.
         These parameters can be changed with the -X flag or 
         with %% statements in the abc file or in a .fmt file.
         When using -X, a flag such as -X 0.6 will change both
         values. To change them separately, use something like
         -X 0.3,0.7 on the command line.
         
         As usual, %% directives can be inspected with abc -H 
         and help about flags is obtained with abc -h.

         Files voices.abc and bach.abc have examples for multistave
         music.

01.03.98 Changed -d flag to accept incremental changes such as -d-5
         or -d+5.

28.12.97 Transposing added. Also double sharp and double flat symbols.
         To transpose: use flag -t in two possible ways.
         (1) Specify the new root explicitly using the form
             -t XX   where XX is the new root note. For example:
               -t C   or   -t Bb  or  -t C#
             This shifts either up or down, depending on which shift is
             smaller. To force up or down direction, use prefixes ^_ eg.
               -t ^C   or   -t _C
         (2) Specify the number of halftones to shift by in the form
             -t nn  where nn is the number of halftones.
             For negative shift, use either a sticky argument
             such as -t-2 or prefix with underscore, eg -t _2.

         In any case: the program first decides how many halftones
         to shift the pitches by. This number is kept fixed throughout
         the whole tune. In this way, key changes within the tune
         are treated properly. 

         To obain information about the transposing process, set the
         verbosity to 3 or 4 (ie:  -v 3  or  -v 4).

   
24.12.97 Shift up guitar chords over n-plet brackets.

15.12.97 Some modifications to extent of 1st and 2nd endings. 

29.11.97 Q: field now prints out tempo denotations.
         General form is Q: w1 w2 w3.. where each word is either
         a string in double quotes such as "Andante" or "Bossa Nova"
         or a tempo denotation such as C or C=120 or 120.
         Strings are printed directly, denotations are translated 
         to the form note=100. Font is in new format field "tempofont".

29.11.97 Guitar chords positioned a bit more nicely (centered,
         except if especially wide).

29.11.97 Added blank-delimited +8 and -8 as extensions to key specifier.
         Function: write all notes higher or lower by one octave.

02.11.97 Words for vocals now centered under each note, looks nicer.
         Changed left/right spacings to get better positioning for 
         single note in a bar.

----- Version 1.2.5 -----

05.10.97 Added page numbers for flag -N. 

05.10.97 Support for all modes (Wil Macaulay)

07.08.97 Added "x" for rests which are invisible.

14.07.97 Slurs and ties within chords improved, for example:
         [(a(b] [c)d)]  slurs a to c, b to d 
         [a-b] [ac]     ties a to a

14.07.97 Grace notes can be before or after guitar chord:
         "A"{A}Bc  and  {A}"A"Bc  both work.

06.05.97 Fixed bug which sometimes put stems onto whole notes.

06.03.97 Begintext lines can start with %%, to permit usage
         in header fields and avoid conflict with other programs.

17.02.97 Made txt array global.. avoid stack problems on Mac.
         Added extra buffer flush at file end.

15.02.97 C (alto) clef added, invoke with "K: alto"

10.02.97 Now  \- in vocals for '-' without breaking the word.
         Changed to work even if no 'T:' field.
         Fixed bug: did not print 'O:' if no 'C:'.

09.02.97 Added "%%titlecaps" format statement.

07.02.97 Introduced decoration T for "tr" above a note. 

----- Version 1.2.4b -----

06.02.97 New: text, page formats, pseudocomments, bass clef.

02.02.97 In-line escape sequences now also [..]

23.01.97 removed "or:" from subtitles.


----- Version 1.2.3-x1 -----

26.11 Added aligned vocals under the staff. Example:
      BA |: "Gm"G2AB|"C7"cd2e|"F"f2fe|"Dm"dA2d|
      w: Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, to-mor-row I'll miss you; re-
      "Bb"d2dc|"Gm"B2GF|"Eb"G4-|G2 z2|
      w:mem-ber I'll al-ways be true._ 
      Syntax:
         Words are given in line starting as w: under music line.
         Words are aligned one-by-one with the notes. 
         * skips one note.
         | tabs forward to next bar line.
         Hyphenations make two syllables, with "-" between them.
         Underscore draws horizontal line from last word to note.
         Blanks can be dropped around special chars (* | - _ ).

19.11 Added bagpipe mode for K:HP.
      Added landscape orientation for flag -l.

05.11 Put in some first pseudocomments to format output:
      %%sep                         - writes a standard separator
      %%sep topspace botspace len   - custom separator
      %%newpage                     - force page break
      %%text This is a line..       - write a line of text
      %%vskip xx                    - add vertical space in cm 

06.10 Added 32nd and 64th rests, 64th notes.
      Accidentals and grace notes more spaced when room.
      Correct treatment of slurs at 1st, 2nd endings.

----- Version 1.2.2 -----

22.09 Words like "aza" now under one beam with rest under it.
      Output "Origin" field in parens together with composer.
      Added ties between chords.
   
20.09 Keysigs such as "3+4/8"  "78/8"  "7 8/8" allowed.
      Slopes of beams tuned a bit.
      Fixed bug in position of tilde over stem.
      Choose same stem directions on neighbors where reasonable.

15.09 Small random horizontal shift of notes improve readability,
      see RANFAC. Adjust internote spacing according to jump in pitch.

05.08 Consistent handling for word breaks at end of input line.


----- Version 1.2.1 -----

28.07 Added W: for words of song.
      Include notes, discography, transcription in output for -n.
      Removed bug: ninf=0 messed up usage "abc2ps -h".

26.07 Fixed: swallowed meter change sometimes.

21.07 Correct handling of last line of file even if not terminated 
      by a newline character.
      Some fine-tuning for beam position when more than one beam.
      For staff middle, use stem direction from previous note.

18.07 More tolerant of misuse of guitar chords to write general stuff
      above staff; now OK if "...." is alone on a line.
      Minibug in syms.h: 'staff' left junk on PS stack.

17.07 For -c mode: don't complain about underfull; don't stretch
      last staff much when underfull (new parameter BETA_C).

16.07 Fixed obscure bug.. after overfull, sometimes took duration for 
      chord from wrong note, because heads were sorted by pitch.
      Also: use shrinkage from previous staff for undefull last staff.

15.07 Move slide further away for notes with accidentals.

09.07 Selectors before first file also valid; apply to first file.
      Took out atof & atoi calls; main now returns int; changed
      function names def_HD,def_Hd,def_hd.
      

----- Version 1.2 -----

06.07 New flag -O to set output file.

26.06 Added general n-plet syntax "(p:q:r".

10.06 Slurs fatter in middle.
      Hold (fermata) added code=H.
      Changed code for bar to M (em-phasis).
      Added up and down bow u,v.

09.06 Thick-thin, thin thick bars now [| and |].
      Ties a-b-c now done correctly.
      Carryover slurs at start and end of line.

08.06 Flat beams shifted to consistent positions relative to staff.

07.06 Set beta0 to avoid infinite stretching.
      Redid key changes.. mcl.abc Cm-> C was wrong.
      Fiddled some with slurs.

05.06 Fixed: accidental was too close on full note.

03.06 fix up n-plet cases: (1) on beam with other notes,
      (2) draw bracket if not on same beam.

03.06 New flag -E to make EPS files eps001.ps, eps002.ps ...

02.05 Guitar chord can be put anywhere before note.
      Changed note placement for single note in bar.

30.04 Mutiple decorations permitted on one note.
      Bar for broad emphasis added, code is R.

29.04 Unions: chord with two identical notes like [CC]

29.04 Slide added, code is J.

26.04 Output buffer takes care of page breaks.

----- Version 1.2x -----

[v1.2-x7]

11.04 Output to <file>.ps possible; set OUTPUTFILE in abc2ps.c

[v1.2-x6]

28.03 Can do normal or pretty output, depending on flag -p.
      Layout parameters bundled as macros in main. 

[v1.2-x5]

21.03 Changed roll symbol some more.
      Put extra \n at end of Out.ps.

[v1.2-x4]

17.03 Fixed nasty bug for selection by xref; now ok on NeXT.
      Changed roll symbol.

[v1.2-x3]

14.03 Added roll sign as optional way to draw ~.
      Changed program to avoid all 'gcc -Wall' warnings.

10.03 Fixed wrong dimension for line in do_index (macro BSIZE)

08.03 Took out '#copies..' in PS file.
      Added -m flag to set margin.

06.03 Added flag -i and interactive mode.
      Fixed bug in beams, which wrote funny numbers over some beams.
      Added "newpage" as option for E: field.

04.03 Added -f flag to permit different selectors for different files.

      Changed meter change within tune: for change at start of line,
      generally writes the symbol (even if the meter did not change),
      but not if the meter change was used only to set the default
      length with 'l' or 's'.

      Removed math calls: cos(phi) and sin(phi) defined explicitly
      in syms.h, also removed sqrt for beam test in music.h.
      Advantage: now compiles without -lm flag.
      (Note: '#include <math.h>' still needed for atof ??)


----- Version 1.1 -----

24.02 Changed to multiple input files, added -e flag to identify
      selectors in argument list.

14.02 Outputs "book" field also for -n flag.
      Chord font changed to Helvetica 12.
